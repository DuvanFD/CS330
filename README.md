How do I approach designing software?

In designing software, I begin by understanding the client's requirements via research and analysis. This helps me create clear, intuitive interfaces and robust functionality that align with client expectations and business goals. In future work, I plan to apply the tactics learned and improving them and incorporating agile methodologies to maintain flexibility and responsiveness. Additionally, my time management is a big factor I was behind on school work to the point that work took a priority in this case due to the amount of projects.  This will help development and ensure that the end product meets both client needs and business objectives effectively.

How do I approach developing programs?

Well as class went by, the more and more challenging it became but also the skills became learned became more and more applicable. Iteration was a big part but I lacked more in depth navigating everything, because I was able to learn but not able to focus on expanding on that due to time constraints and always needing to submit. However just like in most cllassess and even work, it took trial and error until being able to get to a desired checkpoint. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science can aid in achieving my goals by equipping me with problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and proficiency in programming languages. I work in finance with the app support team that is in charge of investment accounting systems and processes for our clients. Regarding the 3D part of this project, I can't really relate to my job, however the coding and the analysis are great to take into account because it definitely allows for a more critical thinking.
